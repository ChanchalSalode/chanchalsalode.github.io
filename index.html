    <h1>Chanchal Kumar Salode</h1>
    <p>
      I’m a fourth-year PhD student at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi, India), advised by Prof. Prasanna R. My research lies at the intersection of operations research, optimization, and artificial intelligence. I specialize in developing large-scale mathematical models (Mixed-Integer Linear/Nonlinear Programming, MILP/MINLP) and AI-driven intelligent optimization algorithms for complex infrastructure and logistics systems. My current focus is on scalable decision-intelligence frameworks that integrate machine learning with optimization to support sustainable planning in transportation, logistics, and infrastructure networks.
  <br/><br/>
     Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Research Associate at the Indian Institute of Management Indore (IIM Indore, India), under the supervision of Prof. Saurabh Chandra.
  <br/><br/> 
      My long-term research vision is to build AI-driven decision-optimization systems that enable sustainable and intelligent infrastructure planning at a global scale.

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      I’m interested in combinatorial optimization, large-scale optimization algorithms, and artificial intelligence. My current research focuses on developing and solving large-scale infrastructure planning and network design problems through AI-driven mathematical modeling (MILP and MINLP) and intelligent optimization techniques that integrate machine learning with exact algorithms.

      Train timetabling with rolling-stock assignment, short-turning and skip-stop strategy for a
      bidirectional metro line

    </p>
    <p>
      Metro timetabling and operational strategies - rolling‐stock assignment, short‐turning, and
      skip‐stop - are integrated into three optimization models that minimize costs, waiting times,
      or both, enabling increased bidirectional service with a limited train fleet. These models,
      deployed on a simplified Santiago Metro Line 1, provide detailed service, running, and
      dwell‑time calculations for both peak and off‑peak operations.
